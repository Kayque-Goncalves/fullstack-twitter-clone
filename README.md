## Building

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your computer in order to build this app.

> With yarn

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kayque-Goncalves/fullstack-twitter-clone.git
$ cd client
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

And in the server side

```bash
$ cd server
$ yarn install

```

_Before execute the dev2 script, make sure you have been created the .env file in the server root directory and added your own mongodb connection string as CONNECTION_URL_
